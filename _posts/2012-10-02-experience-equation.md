================

I like to think there are two kinds of mistakes. The things we regret doing, and the things we regret not doing. Not a new concept, but an important one.

Doing and not succeeding is not “mistake”, it is failure, but it is not mistake.

Here is the biggest difference between the two. The things I regret doing were mistakes but there is nothing I can do to fix them, I can only not repeat them. And then there are the things I regret not doing, here are some examples: not engaging in school to the extent I could have, not continuing hockey when I moved to florida, not pushing relationships to a certain depth, not giving every sprint I’ve ever ran every ounce of my energy, not ever trying to be good at preparing for things…etc. It goes on.

The purpose of the list is for a few concrete examples. And I’m sure in reading it similar examples came to mind.

Recognizing patterns and creating new patterns is an important aspect to growth. So here is what I think all this means.

Things go {A = A - B = C} Dreams = Dreams minus reality = Outcome. Obviously this equation is much more complex, but I’ve already spent an hour re-arranging letters and fractions in the way I think most closely represents the process of experience. The equation of experience.

I’ve always tried to change B. Reality, or B, always is the effort and attempt that goes into life. The freaking thing is though, the stupid minus sign. Humans are flawed so it will always be minus. No matter what. Our best effort is still less than A, no matter what. But for some reason I always try to make B = 0 so that A = C. I have this vague notion that if reality does not effect my dreams, dreams will become my outcome.

Naturally, when people realize B will always be less than A, they lower A in order for A and C, dreams and outcome, to be closely aligned. The thought process is “Since I can not do this well, I will expect less. Sure, my outcome will be less, but it will be closer to A.” EXCEPT, Exponential decrease, meaning when your dreams regress your reality regresses. This means you thought you were lowering C by only -A, but really you are lowering C by (-A + -B)

Lets start fresh {A = A - B = C} {Dream = Dream - Reality = Outcome}

We think we have most control over B. Why? I don’t know. We do have some control over it, but it will always be hindered by the minus sign. A, however, is not hindered by the minus, it is hindered by nothing! For some reason we think that since B always takes away from A, we don’t control A. But that is not true! Nothing stops us from dreaming bigger dreams, having bigger goals! If “exponential decrease” applies then so does “exponential increase.” When we dream bigger we reality bigger!

Let’s change A. I’m sick of always trying to change B and it never working. I am going to dream bigger. Change A.
