<p>Here’s the word. I’m new to this. By this I mean tumblr, but I also mean other things. And by other things I mean, interesting enough, the web.</p>
<p><strong>Let me explain</strong></p>
<p>Lately, people have been all up in my grill asking “timmy, what you gonna study in college?” My response usually is something like “I’m pretty interested in design, specifically web design.” or “I want to be a developer.” or “I’d like to study entrepreneurship, then develop things, and probably design some stuff.”</p>
<p>I don’t have a clue. Really. I don’t even know what all the mush I just assembled into an incredibly vague reply means. The only thing I do know about it all..</p>
<p><strong>I like it</strong></p>
<p>Maybe because it is young, like me. Maybe it’s because there are a lot of people around me who are pretty nifty, and they like it too. Or maybe, just maybe, there’s really no reason at all. I just do.</p>
<p><strong>To the point</strong></p>
<p>I remember texting my brother Robb, near a year ago, my text resembled “I feel like I’m on a diving board at the top of the Design/Development/Entrepreneurship pool, I want to dive in head first.”</p>
<p>I had a layover in Pittsburgh, or Baltimore I think. Actually it may have been Beijing. It was one of the three. I had spent the day reading various Magazines on those topics, and I was gun loaded, off the mother loving wall, amped.</p>
<p><strong>That was a year ago</strong></p>
<p>And when it comes to the web. Web on this computer, Web on my iPhone, iPad. Whatever it may be. I’m still on that board, a year later. I could give you a few reasons why. But, like I remember my brother quoting, maybe even misquoting as I’m about to, “the reason for anything is complete BS.”</p>
<p>I would argue I know a bit more about code, design, and development than my grandma, a lot of my peers, and even my peers grandmas. But first off, who cares. And second off, I probably have a few “closet hacker” buddies that i don’t even realize can hack.</p>
<p>So yeah, my dry feet can still feel the slip resistant epoxy resin on top of that, dumb, dreaded, springy board of pooh. Home to the talkers and not the doers.</p>
<p>Thats the bottom line. THE END. But, in actual ending, CHEERS.</p>
<p>My knees have been bent by fates hand of opportunity, my arms are sticking behind me parallel to that dreaded board of idleness, and my calves are flexing, flexing harder then they ever have in preparation for, well..</p>
<p><strong>blast off</strong></p>
