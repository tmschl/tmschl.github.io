  <p>I'm Tim. I live in San Francisco. I love writing code but I love playing on and leading teams even more.</p>
  <p>Currently slinging `function lawlscript() {};` for <a href="http://neustar.biz">neustar</a>.</p>
  <p>I've done things like attended <a href="http://hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a>, and have worked for companies like <a href="http://futura.io">Futura IO</a> and <a href="http://keen.io">Keen IO</a>.</p>
  <p>If you <3 ECMAscript and you know it clap your hands (dsh dsh).</p>
  <p>If you live in SF reach out and lets go surfing/skating/camping/hiking/coffee licking.</p>
